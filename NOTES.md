This file contains notes about benchmarks.

# Enabled


# Disabled

The following were disabled because of exceeding the 4G memory limit on CircleCI:

- `imaginary/digits-of-e1`
- `imaginary/digits-of-e2`
- `spectral/clausify`
- `spectral/constraints`
- `shootout/pidigits`
- `shootout/n-body`

The following were disabled because of taking too much time:

- `spectral/circsim`
- `smp/threads001`

The following were disabled because of failure:

- `imaginary/integrate` - The output is coming out as `--0.0` instead of `0.0`.


# Port Status from NoFib

- `spectral/ansi` - Appears to require standard input (uses `interact`), but does not provide any input file.
- `spectral/fft2` - Appears to have a wide variety of outputs - hard to test. May be that we have incorrect floating point results.
- `spectral/mandel` - Generated pixmap is way off the expected output. Could be bug in Eta.
